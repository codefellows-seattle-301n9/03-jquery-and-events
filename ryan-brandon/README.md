# 03-jQuery-and-events

**Author**: Ryan Johnson and Brandon Buchholz
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
The application is a blog that has filters for the articles based on specific categories(author or category). Those categories are used to create and store each article for easy viewability and navigation. Also adds functionality for expanding each post if user wants to read more or less.

## Getting Started
Clone repo to your local machine and open index.html on your browser, also added in normalize.css. We then linked in the scripts articleView.js. Then read through the TODO's, Reviews, and Comments.

## Architecture
We used a CDN for our jQuery library and linked it in at the bottom of our HTML. Also used a normailze.css file linked into our HTML at the top of our CSS links so that we start with a consistent browser rendering.
