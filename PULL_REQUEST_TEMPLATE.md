#### Single-line Summary

**Today, Alicia Lycan and Tiger Hsu paired together. It took about 5 hours.**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First, we started working through the TODOs and COMMENTs in the .js files with Alicia driving and Tiger navigating.
  2. Next, we switched driver and navigator roles and continued to work through the TODO items.
  3. Lastly, we filled out the README and organized our files making sure the application requirements had been met and that it was fully-functional.
