**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
<!--We wanted to pull data in the form of objects from blogarticles.js and render the data to the DOM via function expressions in both article.js and articleView.js using author-name and category filters.-->

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
<!--We read through all the TODOs, COMMENTs, REVIEWs, and User Stories. We then linked our articleView.js file to the html file, added a new attribute to the $newArticle in order to pull data and push it into the various tags of our html template.
We then went through articleView.js and completed all the necessary functions and called them all at the bottom.-->
## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
